            <p>I am a 31 year-old student from Washington. I grew up in Kirkland and Bellevue but currently reside in Renton. I attended college at the University of San Diego as well as Bellevue College. I am just now going back to school to expand my skillset and learn web development. My goal is to work in the tech industry. Through the UW coding program I am hoping I will get a good head start.</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy going to concerts, playing sports, watching sports (Go Hawks!), and chilling with my two new kittens, Taco and Tequila. I have a great love for animals and it was my childhood dream to work with lions someday. I still have that dream, but for now I am staying in Washington to work on my career.</p>
